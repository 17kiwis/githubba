            <h2>Duolingo Effectiveness Study  </h2>
            <h3>MAIN RESULTS</h3>
            <p>1. Overall the average improvement in language abilities was 91.4 points and the  improvement was statistically significant.  </p> 
            <p>2.The effectiveness measure showed that on average participants gained 8.1 points per one  hour of study with Duolingo.   </p>
            <p>3.The 95% Confidence Interval for the effectiveness is from 5.6 points to 10.7 points gained  per one hour of study.  </p>
            <p>4.The study estimated that a person with no knowledge of Spanish would need between 26  and 49 hours (or 34 hours on average) to cover the material for the first college semester  of Spanish. This result is based on the language testâ€™s cutQoff point for the second college  semester and the 95% Confidence Interval of the effectiveness measure.  </p>
            <p>5.The main factor for higher effectiveness was the motivation of the participants, with  people studying for travel gaining the most and people studying for personal interest  gaining the least.  </p>
            <p>6.Another factor for higher effectiveness was the initial level of knowledge of Spanish with  beginners gaining the most and more advanced learners gaining the least.
